        <p>Extra features</p>
        <p>-Hold shift to display a preview of the shape you are about to place. The preview disappears when the shift key is no longer pressed.
            <br>Note: after clicking on UI (such as a button or slider), you have to click on a blank area outside of the canvas for the shape preview to work again (I think some weird interaction with events and UI)</p>
        <p>-Added an Undo button that removes the last shape that was placed</p>
        <p>-Added a slider for alpha to allow transparent paint</p>
        <p>-Added a function to scale and convert a 2D coordinate system into coordinates for the WebGL canvas</p>
        <p>-The points in the picture (part 12) are added to the point list (so they can be undone using the Undo button too)</p>
